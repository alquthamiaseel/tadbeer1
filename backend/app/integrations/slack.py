"""Slack integration.

Slack is the conversation hub: it is where requirements arrive, where the agent
reports, and where a human approves or rejects what it produced. This module is
the boundary — it captures messages, handles `/pm`, and posts results. It holds
no pipeline logic of its own; that lives in the orchestrator.

Socket Mode, not webhooks. The app opens an outbound WebSocket to Slack, so
there is no public URL, no tunnel to configure, and nothing to expire in the
middle of a demo.

Two properties this module has to get right:

* **Capture is idempotent.** Slack redelivers events, so the same message can
  arrive twice. Messages are keyed on (channel, ts) and a duplicate is dropped
  rather than doubling up in the transcript.
* **Handlers acknowledge fast.** Slack times out a slash command in 3 seconds,
  but a pipeline run takes minutes, so commands acknowledge immediately and the
  run continues in the background.
