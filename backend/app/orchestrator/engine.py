"""The pipeline engine.

Walks a run through the six stages in order. The engine owns everything that is
the same for every stage — timing, status transitions, persistence, retries,
approval gates — so a stage only has to produce its artifact.

Two properties matter and both come from the same decision, that state lives in
the database rather than in memory:

* **Resumable.** :func:`advance` starts from the first stage that is not
  complete, so a crash, a restart, or an exhausted free-tier quota costs the
  current stage and nothing before it.
* **Re-runnable.** Any single stage can be reset and run again with feedback,
  because its inputs are artifacts on disk, not values held by a caller.
