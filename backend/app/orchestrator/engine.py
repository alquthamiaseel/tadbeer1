"""The pipeline engine.

Walks a run through the six stages in order. The engine owns everything that is
the same for every stage — timing, status transitions, retries, approval
gates — so a stage only has to produce its artifact.

State lives in memory, in the ``store`` module, for the lifetime of the run:

* **Resumable within the process.** :func:`advance` starts from the first
  stage that is not complete, so calling it again after a transient failure
  costs only the current stage.
* **Re-runnable.** Any single stage can be reset and run again with feedback,
  because its inputs are artifacts already attached to the run, not values held
  by a caller.
