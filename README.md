# pm-fyp — Agentic AI Project Manager

An AI system that turns stakeholder conversation into delivered project artifacts, end to end,
with a human in the loop.

It listens in **Slack**, extracts requirements, drafts a project plan and asks for approval,
then expands the approved plan into a **Work Breakdown Structure pushed into Asana** (with
dependencies and constraints), generates **system design diagrams** as Mermaid, and finally
generates a **low-fidelity prototype** committed to **GitHub** and deployed live on **Vercel**.
A dashboard shows every stage, artifact, and approval in real time.

## Pipeline

```
Slack conversation
      │
      ▼
  1. INGEST     → structured requirements
  2. PLAN       → project plan ──── human approval in Slack ────┐
  3. WBS        → task tree + dependencies → Asana              │ feedback re-runs the stage
  4. DESIGN     → Mermaid use-case / architecture / ERD / seq   │
  5. PROTOTYPE  → static site → GitHub repo → Vercel deploy      │
  6. DONE       → dashboard summary + Slack recap ──────────────┘
```

Each stage is a single LLM call with a forced JSON schema, writing its output to the database
before the next stage runs. Runs are resumable: a crash or rate limit picks up from the last
completed stage, and any individual stage can be re-run with feedback.

## Architecture

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic, Pydantic v2 |
| LLM | Gemini (`gemini-3.6-flash`, free tier) with schema-constrained output per stage |
| Slack | `slack-bolt` in Socket Mode — no public URL required |
| Jobs | In-process asyncio worker with DB-backed run state |
| Database | Postgres 16 (Docker Compose) |
| Frontend | Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind, client-side Mermaid rendering |

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in the tokens
make install                # install backend + frontend dependencies
make db                     # start Postgres
make check                  # verify every API credential works
make migrate                # create database tables
make dev                    # backend + Slack listener + dashboard
```

Open the dashboard at http://localhost:3000, then invite the bot to a Slack
channel, discuss what you want built, and run `/pm start`.

To rehearse without typing a conversation:

```bash
make seed c=C0123456789     # load a canned stakeholder conversation
make e2e  c=C0123456789     # run all six stages for real and check the result
```

Full setup, including the Slack app and each token, is in
[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

## Credentials required

See `.env.example` for where to obtain each one. `make check` verifies all of them before you
start; nothing else will work until it reports all-green.

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Gemini | The LLM behind every pipeline stage (free tier, no card required) |
| Slack | Conversation capture and approval buttons (Socket Mode) |
| Asana | Where the Work Breakdown Structure is published |
| GitHub | Where the generated prototype is committed |
| Vercel | Where the generated prototype is deployed |

## Layout

```
backend/app/orchestrator/            the six-stage state machine
backend/app/orchestrator/stages/     one module per pipeline stage
backend/app/integrations/            Slack, Asana, GitHub, Vercel clients
backend/app/schemas/                 Pydantic models — also the LLM output schemas
backend/app/llm/                     Gemini client and the schema converter
backend/scripts/                     credential check, seed, end-to-end acceptance
frontend/                            Next.js dashboard
docs/                                setup, architecture, requirements, demo script
```
